      <div class="imgText">Tying Knots in Virtual Reality <br>
        <p class="projectText"> This 2022 virtual reality project was an exploration in creating a physics interaction system for tying virtual rope. I wrote the physics system using a position-based dynamics approach, and designed a user interface that took inspiration from knitting needles in order to compensate for the lack of dexterity in vr. With this project I sought to improve the expressive range of players in virtual reality. </p>

        <p class="projectText"> This interactive game project was made for a gallery instalation and has been shown in faculty exhibitions at the Zoller gallery of Penn State University, and the Recitiation hall gallery at the Univeristy of Delaware. Players control rival ants trying to push each other off of a leaf. The work accompanies a series of oil paintings.</p>

            <div class="imgText">Spinpixel<br>
        <p class="projectText"> This interactive project attempted to remimagine the digital art application through embodied design by creating a virtual space to create work in. The program itself is an reimagining of a unique painting process not readily imitated in most creative software. User's create "spin art" and by dropping various paint onto a canvas, while a custom-made eulerian fluid sim moves the pigment in unexpected ways. User's can then export their images for future enjoyment.
